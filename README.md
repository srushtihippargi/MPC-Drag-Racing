# **Non-linear MPC for maximum distance and obstacle avoidance**                                                                 
Implemented a NMPC system to overtake the leading vehicle considering the constraints such as lane keeping, input bounds, and collision avoidance optimizing for maximum distance travelled in the x-direction, achieving 1374.22 units. The control system successfully minimized deviations from the y=0 axis, with a low standard deviation of 18.25 units. 

# Car Dynamics

We consider the car dynamics with lumped rear and front tire forces.
